**Summary**

I am currently employed as a systems engineer leading a small team of Unix/Linux system
administrators to provide 24x7 support for enterprise services hosted on approximately 500 servers for The George Washington University. In my current role I have taken responsibility for maturing our operational processes and integration between support groups to allow for a more full adoption of common DevOps processes and reduce the time needed to build solutions both on premises and as the organization begins to move services into AWS.

In my 22 years of full time employment at the George Washington University I have been asked to fill the roles of programmer, manager, application administrator, trainer, and team lead in addition to my functions as a systems engineer. These roles have provided me with a wealth of experience and ability to perform a large number of roles that I believe make me an asset to any organization.
